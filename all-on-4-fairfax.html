            <h2>What Are All-on-4 Dental Implants?</h2>
            <p>All-on-4 dental implants involve placing <strong>four titanium implants</strong> into the jawbone to support a complete arch of prosthetic teeth. This innovative method allows for a full set of teeth to be replaced with fewer implants compared to traditional methods. It is ideal for patients with significant tooth loss or those who want a stable, long-lasting alternative to dentures.</p>

            <h2>Key Benefits of All-on-4 Dental Implants</h2>
            <p>All-on-4 implants offer numerous advantages over conventional dentures and traditional implant techniques:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>1. Permanent Stability:</strong></h3>
                    Unlike dentures, All-on-4 implants are securely fixed in place, providing unmatched stability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>2. Natural Appearance:</strong></h3>
                    Custom-designed teeth mimic the appearance and function of natural teeth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>3. Quick Results:</strong></h3>
                    Many patients receive temporary teeth on the same day as the implant procedure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>4. Bone Health:</strong></h3>
                    Implants stimulate the jawbone, preventing bone loss and preserving facial structure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>5. Cost-Effective: </strong></h3>
                    Requires only four implants per arch, reducing the overall cost compared to placing individual implants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>6. Improved Quality of Life:</strong></h3>
                    Eat, speak, and smile with confidence without worrying about dentures slipping.
