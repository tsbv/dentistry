            <li><strong>1.	Increased Online Visibility:</strong> SEO ensures your website appears at the top of local search results when patients look for dental services in your area.</li>
            <li><strong>2.	Attracts Targeted Traffic:</strong> With proper SEO, you attract patients actively searching for the services you offer.</li>
            <li><strong>3.	Improves Credibility:</strong> Ranking high on Google builds trust and credibility, as patients often associate top rankings with reputable practices.</li>
            <li><strong>4.	Cost-Effective Marketing:</strong> SEO is one of the most cost-efficient ways to market your dental practice compared to traditional advertising methods.</li>
