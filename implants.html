            <h3>1. Tom Cruise</h3>
            <p>Tom Cruise's natural teeth, seen in early films like <i>Risky Business</i>, were far from Hollywood-perfect. With noticeable gaps, chips, and misalignment, the actor's smile underwent a dramatic transformation. By the time he starred in <i>Mission Impossible</i>, Cruise had braces and porcelain veneers that closed gaps and created a brighter, more symmetrical appearance. Today, his flawless smile complements his leading-man charm.</p>

            <h3>2. George Clooney</h3>
            <p>Known for his timeless appeal, George Clooney wasn’t always known for his impeccable smile. Early in his career, Clooney’s teeth were visibly shorter, likely due to bruxism (teeth grinding). This habit, which can wear down teeth over time, may have contributed to his need for cosmetic dentistry. Veneers were used to restore the length and brightness of his teeth, resulting in a polished, classic Hollywood smile.</p>

            <h3>3. Mike Tyson</h3>
            <p>Boxing legend Mike Tyson’s smile has undergone several transformations. Known for his trademark gap-toothed grin, Tyson initially closed the gap with veneers. Later, he had the gap restored as a nod to his original look. Tyson’s boxing career also left him with missing teeth, which were replaced with dental implants. His story showcases how cosmetic dentistry can both restore function and maintain a signature appearance.</p>

            <h3>4. Miley Cyrus</h3>
            <p>As Disney Channel’s <i>Hannah Montana</i>, Miley Cyrus charmed fans with her slightly crooked but adorable smile. As her career progressed, Miley opted for veneers to achieve the straighter, whiter teeth she now flaunts. Her transformation from a Disney starlet to a global pop icon was complemented by her glowing smile.</p>

            <h3>5. Victoria Beckham</h3>
            <p>Before her rise to fame as Posh Spice, Victoria Beckham had less-than-perfect teeth. Her left front tooth was noticeably angled toward the midline. Veneers reshaped and brightened her smile, giving her the sophisticated and polished look she’s now famous for. Beckham’s dental transformation is a testament to the power of cosmetic enhancements.</p>

            <h3>6. Christie Brinkley</h3>
            <p>The supermodel has always been admired for her beauty, but a helicopter crash left her with two broken molars. Dental implants replaced the damaged teeth, seamlessly restoring her smile. Brinkley often praises the natural look and feel of her implants, crediting them for helping her maintain her iconic appearance.</p>

            <p>After a severe motorcycle accident in 1988, Gary Busey required extensive dental restoration. The injuries he sustained to his face necessitated implants and other dental work to repair his smile. While much of the work was functional, it also enhanced his overall appearance.</p>

            <p>Morgan Freeman’s captivating voice isn’t his only standout feature. His smile has also received a makeover. Freeman’s earlier look included a gap between his front teeth and some discoloration, both of which were corrected with veneers or bonding. The result is a brighter, more uniform smile that adds to his ageless appeal.</p>

            <h3>11. Ben Affleck</h3>
            <p>Before his Hollywood breakthrough, Ben Affleck’s teeth were shorter and had visible gaps. As part of his preparation for <i>Armageddon</i>, producer Jerry Bruckheimer arranged for the actor to receive dental caps. These enhancements lengthened his teeth, eliminated gaps, and brightened his smile, contributing to his leading-man allure.</p>
