            <h2>What is a Fractured or Cracked Tooth?</h2>
            <p>A fractured tooth refers to any break, crack, or split in the structure of a tooth. These cracks can range from minor surface lines to significant splits that jeopardize the integrity of the tooth.</p>
            <ul class="fractured-tooth__list">
              <li class="fractured-tooth__item">
                <p><strong>Craze lines</strong> are minor cracks on the enamel and are typically harmless.</p>

              <li class="fractured-tooth__item">
                <p><strong>Fractured cusp</strong> involves a break around a dental filling without reaching the tooth’s pulp.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="fractured-tooth__item">
                <p><strong>Vertical cracks</strong> extend from the crown to the root and can cause severe issues if left untreated.</p>

              <li class="fractured-tooth__item">
                <p><strong>Split tooth</strong> is a severe form of vertical crack where the tooth separates into segments.</p>

              <li class="fractured-tooth__item">
                <p><strong>Root fracture</strong> occurs below the gum line and can be difficult to detect without professional evaluation.</p>

            <h2>Causes of a Cracked Tooth</h2>
            <p>Several factors can lead to a fractured or cracked tooth, including:</p>
            <ul class="when-necessary__list">
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                  <p><strong>1. Biting Hard Objects:</strong> Chewing hard foods like nuts, ice, or hard candy can put excessive pressure on teeth.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                  <p><strong>2.	Trauma or Injury:</strong> Accidents, falls, or sports injuries can result in a cracked tooth.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                    <p><strong>3.	Grinding and Clenching:</strong> Chronic teeth grinding (bruxism) weakens the enamel over time.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                  <p><strong>4.	Age:</strong> As you age, your teeth naturally weaken, making them more susceptible to cracks.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                  <p><strong>5.	Temperature Changes:</strong> Extreme changes in temperature, like eating hot food and immediately drinking something cold, can cause enamel stress.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If a tooth is fractured below the gum line and cannot be restored with a crown or filling, extraction is often the best option.</p>

            <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Diagnosing a fractured tooth often requires a visit to a dentist. During the examination, the dentist may:</p>
            <ul class="diagnosis-cracked-tooth__list">
                <li class="diagnosis-cracked-tooth__item">Use a magnifying glass or dental dye to detect cracks.</li>
                <li class="diagnosis-cracked-tooth__item">Perform a bite test to identify the affected area.</li>
                <li class="diagnosis-cracked-tooth__item">Use X-rays to check for damage to the tooth structure or surrounding bone.</li>
                <li class="diagnosis-cracked-tooth__item">Probe the gums for signs of infection near the cracked tooth.</li>

            <h2>Treatment Options for a Cracked Tooth</h2>
            <p>The treatment for a cracked tooth depends on the severity of the crack and its location. Here are the most common treatment options:</p>
            <ol class="treatment-options__list">
                <li class="treatment-options__item">
                    <p><strong>Dental Bonding</strong> For minor cracks or chips, bonding can restore the tooth’s appearance and functionality. A tooth-colored resin is applied to the damaged area and hardened with a special light.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="treatment-options__item">
                    <p><strong>Dental Crown</strong> A crown may be used for more significant cracks to cover and protect the tooth. Crowns are typically made of porcelain, metal, or a combination and are custom-fitted to your tooth.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="treatment-options__item">
                    <p><strong>Root Canal Therapy</strong> If the crack extends into the pulp of the tooth, a root canal may be necessary to remove infected tissue and save the tooth. After the procedure, a crown is often placed for additional protection.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="treatment-options__item">
                    <p><strong>Extraction</strong> In cases where the crack is severe and the tooth cannot be salvaged, extraction may be the only option. After extraction, options like implants or bridges can replace the missing tooth.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="treatment-options__item">
                    <p><strong>Onlays or Inlays</strong> These custom-made restorations are used for moderately damaged teeth when crowns are not necessary.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="treatment-options__item">
                    <p><strong>Preventive Measures Post-Treatment</strong> A treated tooth may still be vulnerable. Your dentist may recommend using a mouthguard if you grind your teeth or avoiding hard foods.</p>
