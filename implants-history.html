            <h1>The History and Evolution of Dental Implants</h1>
            <p>Dental implants, while now a cutting-edge solution, are not a new concept. Evidence of rudimentary implants dates back thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered ancient skulls with shells or carved stones inserted into jawbones, suggesting early attempts at tooth replacement.</p>
            <p>Modern dental implants as we know them began taking shape in the mid-20th century when Swedish orthopedic surgeon Dr. Per-Ingvar Brånemark discovered that titanium could bond with bone, a process known as <strong>osseointegration</strong>. This discovery revolutionized dentistry, setting the foundation for today’s implants.</p>
            <p>Advances in technology, materials, and techniques have since made implants more reliable, durable, and accessible.</p>

            <p>There are several types of dental implants, each suited for specific needs and circumstances:</p>
            <ol class="implants-types__list">
              <li class="implants-types__item">
                  <h3><strong>Endosteal Implants</strong></h3>
                  <p>The most common type, these implants are surgically placed into the jawbone. They are ideal for patients with healthy bone density and come in two main forms:</p>
                  <ul class="endosteal-implants-list">
                      <li class="endosteal-implants-list__item">
                          <strong>Screw-Type:</strong> Most widely used, providing stability and strength.
                      </li>
                      <li class="endosteal-implants-list__item">
                          <strong>Cylinder-Type:</strong> Used in cases where bone density is slightly lower.

                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="implants-types__item">
                  <h3><strong>Subperiosteal Implants</strong></h3>
                  <p>Placed under the gum but above the jawbone, these are an option for patients with insufficient bone density who cannot undergo bone grafting.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="implants-types__item">
                  <h3><strong>Mini Implants</strong></h3>
                  <p>These smaller implants are less invasive and often used for temporary solutions or to stabilize dentures. They are less expensive but not as durable as traditional implants.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="implants-types__item">
                  <h3><strong>Zygomatic Implants</strong></h3>
                  <p>Designed for patients with severe bone loss in the upper jaw, these implants anchor into the cheekbone instead of the jawbone.</p>

            <h2>The True Cost of Not Getting Dental Implants</h2>
            <p>While dental implants may seem expensive initially, the cost of ignoring tooth replacement can be even higher:</p>
            <ul class="not-getting-implants__list">
                <li class="not-getting-implants__item">
                    <p><strong>1.	Bone Loss</strong> Missing teeth lead to jawbone deterioration, altering facial structure and causing a sunken appearance.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="not-getting-implants__item">
                    <p><strong>2.	Shifting Teeth:</strong> Adjacent teeth may shift into the empty space, leading to misalignment, bite issues, and increased wear on remaining teeth.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="not-getting-implants__item">
                    <p><strong>3.	Gum Health:</strong> The gap left by a missing tooth can trap food and bacteria, increasing the risk of gum disease.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="not-getting-implants__item">
                    <p><strong>4.	Reduced Quality of Life:</strong> Missing teeth can affect your ability to chew and speak, diminishing your confidence and daily comfort.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Investing in dental implants early can prevent these complications and save money on corrective treatments later.</p>

            <h2>Customizing Dental Implant Treatment Plans</h2>
            <p>Every patient is unique, and so is their dental implant journey. Dentists take several factors into account when designing a treatment plan:</p>
            <ol class="customizing-implant-plans__list">
                <li class="customizing-implant-plans__item">
                  <p><strong>Oral Health:</strong> Healthy gums and bone are essential for successful implantation. Any existing conditions, such as periodontal disease, must be treated first.</p>

                <li class="customizing-implant-plans__item">
                  <p><strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Smokers or individuals with chronic health conditions may need additional precautions or treatments.</p>

                <li class="customizing-implant-plans__item">

            <h2>How Long Do Dental Implants Last?</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest advantages of dental implants is their longevity. With proper care, they can last a lifetime. However, several factors influence their lifespan:</p>
            <ul class="how-long-last__list">
                <li class="how-long-last__item">
                    <p><strong>Oral Hygiene:</strong> Daily brushing and flossing are critical to preventing peri-implantitis, a condition similar to gum disease that affects implants.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="how-long-last__item">
                    <p><strong>Regular Checkups:</strong> Routine dental visits allow your dentist to monitor and maintain your implants.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="how-longh-last__item">
                    <p><strong>Lifestyle Choices:</strong> Avoiding habits like smoking or grinding teeth can extend the life of your implants.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The crown or prosthetic attached to the implant may need replacement after 10–15 years, but the implant itself often remains intact.</p>
