            <h2>What Is Tooth Extraction?</h2>
            <p>Tooth extraction is the removal of a tooth from its socket in the jawbone. While preserving natural teeth is always the goal, extractions are necessary in certain situations to prevent further dental issues or alleviate pain. Thanks to modern dentistry, tooth extraction is a straightforward procedure that prioritizes patient comfort and safety.</p>

            <h2>When Is a Tooth Extraction Necessary?</h2>
            <p>TA dentist may recommend extracting a tooth for several reasons. Here are some of the most common scenarios:</p>
            <ul class="when-necessary__list">
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                    <h3>1. Severe Tooth Decay or Damage</h3>
                    <p>When a tooth is extensively decayed or damaged beyond repair, an extraction may be necessary to prevent the spread of infection to surrounding teeth and gums.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                    <h3>2. Impacted Wisdom Teeth</h3>
                    <p>Wisdom teeth, or third molars, often become impacted, causing pain, swelling, or even infection. Removing impacted wisdom teeth can prevent complications such as crowding or damage to adjacent teeth.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                    <h3>3. Overcrowding</h3>
                    <p>To prepare for orthodontic treatment or create space for other teeth to align correctly, one or more teeth may need to be removed.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                    <h3>4. Gum Disease</h3>
                    <p>Advanced periodontal disease can loosen teeth, sometimes necessitating their removal to maintain overall oral health.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="when-necessary__item">
                    <h3>5. Broken Teeth</h3>
                    <p>If a tooth is fractured below the gum line and cannot be restored with a crown or filling, extraction is often the best option.</p>
                </li>

            <ol class="aftercare-tips__list">
                <li class="aftercare-tips__item">

                    <p><strong>Oral Hygiene:</strong> Gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water after 24 hours to keep the area clean. Avoid brushing the extraction site directly for a few days.</p>
