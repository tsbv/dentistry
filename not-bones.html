            <h1>If Teeth Are Not Bones, What Are They? A Comprehensive Exploration</h1>
            <p>Our body, teeth, and bones are often grouped together because they seem so similar—both are hard, white, and essential to our structure and function. However, despite their apparent similarities, teeth are not bones. So, if teeth aren’t bones, what exactly are they? And what makes them unique compared to the skeletal system?</p>
            <p>This comprehensive guide will explore the composition, function, and fascinating distinctions between teeth and bones. By understanding these differences, you’ll gain a deeper appreciation for your oral health and learn how to care for your teeth properly. Let's unravel the mystery of teeth, their unique role in our body, and why they are so much more than "just like bones."</p>

                    <h3>Natural Appearance</h3>
                    <p>Dental implants look and feel like natural teeth, providing a seamless smile that's indistinguishable from real teeth. They're custom-made to match your existing teeth in color and shape.</p>

                <li class="keywords__item">
                    <h3>Durability</h3>
                    <p>With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last for decades or even a lifetime. They're made from biocompatible materials that integrate with your natural bone structure.</p>

                    <h3>Improved Functionality</h3>
                    <p>Implants restore full chewing ability and speech clarity, allowing you to eat your favorite foods and speak confidently without worry about slippage or discomfort.</p>

            <h2>Are Teeth Not Bones?</h2>
            <p>At first glance, it seems logical to assume teeth are bones. After all, both are composed of hard tissue, essential to the human body's function, and dependent on proper care and nutrition for longevity. However, teeth and bones have entirely different structures, compositions, and roles in the body.</p>
            <p>Here’s the key distinction:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bones</strong> are living tissues that continually grow and regenerate.</li>
                <li><strong>Teeth</strong> are not living tissues and cannot regenerate once damaged. Instead, teeth are considered part of the body's <strong>dental system</strong>, not the skeletal system.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="section section--gray teeth-made" id="teeth-made">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>What Are Teeth Made Of?</h2>
            <p>To understand what teeth are, it's essential to break down their composition. Teeth are made of multiple layers, each with a unique function and structure.</p>
            <ol class="teeth-made__list">
                <li class="teeth-made__item">
                  <h3><strong>Enamel</strong></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Enamel is the outermost layer of the tooth, the part that you see when you smile. It is the hardest and most mineralized substance in the human body.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Enamel is composed of 96% hydroxyapatite, a crystalline calcium phosphate mineral, with the remaining 4% consisting of water and organic materials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The primary function of enamel is to protect the underlying structures of the tooth from wear and tear, as well as from acids and bacteria that cause decay.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="teeth-made__item">
                  <h3><strong>Dentin</strong></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Beneath the enamel lies dentin, a yellowish layer that makes up the majority of the tooth's structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Dentin is less hard than enamel but still quite strong, made of 70% hydroxyapatite, 20% organic materials, and 10% water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Dentin supports the enamel and provides the tooth with its flexibility, preventing fractures. It also contains microscopic tubules that can transmit sensations like heat, cold, or pain to the inner part of the tooth.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="teeth-made__item">
                  <h3><strong>Pulp</strong></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> The innermost layer of the tooth is the pulp, a soft tissue containing nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> The pulp is made entirely of living tissues and is the only part of the tooth with regenerative capabilities to a certain extent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Pulp provides nutrients to the tooth during development and is responsible for signaling pain when the tooth is damaged or infected.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="teeth-made__item">
                  <h3><strong>Cementum</strong></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Cementum is a specialized calcified layer that covers the tooth's roots, anchoring it to the jawbone via periodontal ligaments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Cementum is composed of 45–50% hydroxyapatite and 50–55% organic materials and water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It plays a critical role in stabilizing the tooth within the jaw.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, additional procedures like bone grafting or sinus lifts can increase the total cost. To better understand the financial commitment, let’s break down the typical expenses.</p>

            <p>Teeth are classified as part of the <strong>dental system</strong>, which includes the gums, jawbones, and connective tissues like periodontal ligaments. Together, these components work to support the teeth and maintain oral health.</p>
            <p>Teeth are calcified tissues, hardened by minerals like calcium and phosphate. Despite their hardness, teeth are unique compared to other calcified tissues in the body, as they lack the regenerative capabilities of bones.</p>

            <p>The inability of teeth to heal once damaged stems from their unique structure and composition:</p>

                    <h3>1. Lack of Living Cells in Enamel</h3>

                        <li>Unlike bone, which contains living cells like osteoblasts and osteoclasts that facilitate growth and repair, enamel is entirely composed of minerals. Once enamel is damaged, it cannot regenerate because it has no cells to repair.</li>

                        <li>Bones are highly vascularized, meaning they receive a steady supply of blood that brings nutrients and promotes healing. Teeth rely on the blood supply in the pulp, but this is not enough to repair damage to the outer layers.</li>

          <h2>How Are Teeth and Bones Connected?</h2>
          <p>While teeth are not bones, they are closely related to the skeletal system, particularly the jawbone. Teeth are anchored in the jawbone through sockets and supported by periodontal ligaments. The health of the jawbone is essential for teeth' stability; when bone loss occurs (often due to conditions like periodontitis), teeth can become loose or fall out.</p>

            <div class="conclusion__content">
                <p>While teeth may look like bones at first glance, they are a unique and distinct body part. Unlike bones, teeth are not living tissues, lack regenerative capabilities, and are classified as part of the dental rather than the skeletal system. Understanding these differences is key to appreciating the importance of oral health and taking proactive steps to care for your teeth.</p>
                <p>Teeth may not heal like bones, but proper care and maintenance can last a lifetime, allowing you to chew, speak, and smile confidently. Remember, your teeth are more than just tools for eating—they are an integral part of your overall health and well-being. Treat them with the care they deserve!</p>
