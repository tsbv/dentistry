        <h2 class="h2-block">Why You Might Need a Tooth Extraction in Fairfax, VA</h2>
        <p>Understanding when a tooth extraction is necessary starts with knowing common triggers. At our practice, we evaluate every case carefully to decide if <strong>tooth extraction Fairfax</strong> is the right step. Let’s look at key scenarios where this procedure might be recommended.</p>
        <h3 class="h3-block">Severe Decay or Damage</h3>
        <div class="block-grid-medium mt40 item-center mb40">
        <div class="block-grid1 order2"><img src="https://fairfax-dentist-va.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Severe-Decay-or-Damage.webp" alt="Severe Decay or Damage." width="400" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1546 mb-20mob mt-30mob" /></div>
        <div class="block-grid2 order1">
        <p>Severe decay or trauma that destroys tooth structure beyond repair may require removal. If a tooth can’t be saved with fillings or crowns, extraction prevents infection spread. We prioritize saving teeth whenever possible, but sometimes this step is critical to long-term health.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="h3-block">Advanced Gum Disease</h3>
        <p>Advanced gum disease weakens bone support, causing loose teeth. In severe cases, removal may be needed to stop infection from harming surrounding teeth or overall health. Our <strong>Fairfax dentist va</strong> team provides gentle care for these complex cases.</p>
        <h3 class="h3-block">Impacted Wisdom Teeth</h3>
        <p>Wisdom teeth that don’t erupt properly (impacted) can damage adjacent teeth or cause pain. Proactive removal often prevents future complications. Early evaluation by your <strong>fairfax dentist va</strong> is key to avoiding costly issues later.</p>
        <h3>Orthodontic Treatment Requirements</h3>
        <p>Orthodontic plans sometimes need space for realignment. Removing specific teeth allows proper positioning, ensuring a healthy bite. We collaborate with orthodontists to align care for your smile’s best outcome.</p>
