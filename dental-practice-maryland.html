        <h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
        <p>SEO helps dental websites appear higher in search results. This makes it easier for people to find a dentist online. Good SEO includes using local keywords that relate to dental services in Maryland.</p>

    <section class="sect-gray">
        <h2 class="h2blue" id="leveraging-patient-reviews">Leveraging Patient Reviews and Testimonials</h2>
        <p>Patient reviews and testimonials are powerful tools for dental practices in Maryland. They build trust and credibility with potential patients.</p>
        <p>Encouraging satisfied patients to leave reviews can boost a practice's online reputation. Many happy patients will write a review if asked.</p>
        <p>Dentists should make it easy for patients to share feedback. They can send follow-up emails with links to review sites after appointments.</p>
        <p><strong>Responding to reviews</strong> is crucial. It shows the practice values patient input. Thanking patients for positive reviews reinforces good experiences.</p>
        <p>Addressing negative reviews professionally can turn a bad situation around. It demonstrates commitment to patient satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Patient testimonials can be featured on the practice website and social media. Short quotes work well for marketing materials.</p>

    <section class="sect-gray">
        <h2 id="user-friendly-dental-website" class="h2blue">Developing a User-Friendly Website</h2>
        <p>A user-friendly dental website helps attract and retain patients. It makes finding information and booking appointments easy. Key elements include mobile compatibility, clear calls-to-action, and online booking options.</p>
        <h3>Mobile Compatibility</h3>
        <p>Mobile-friendly websites are crucial for dental practices. Many people use phones to search for dentists and book appointments. A mobile-compatible site adjusts to fit different screen sizes.</p>
        <p>Text should be easy to read on small screens. Buttons need to be large enough to tap with a finger. Images should resize properly on mobile devices.</p>
        <p>Fast loading times are vital for mobile users. Compress images and minimize code to speed up the site. This helps keep potential patients from leaving due to slow load times.</p>
        <h3>Clear Call-to-Actions</h3>
        <p>Clear calls-to-action (CTAs) guide visitors to take desired steps. Common dental website CTAs include "Book an Appointment" and "Contact Us".</p>
        <p>CTAs should stand out visually. Use contrasting colors or button designs. Place them in easy-to-spot locations on the page.</p>
        <p>Use action-oriented language in CTAs. "Schedule Your Cleaning Today" is more effective than "Appointments". Make it clear what will happen when someone clicks the button.</p>
        <p>Test different CTA designs and placements. Track which ones get the most clicks. This helps optimize the website for better results.</p>
        <h3>Online Appointment Booking</h3>
        <p>Online booking makes it convenient for patients to schedule visits. It allows them to book outside of office hours. This can increase appointment numbers and reduce phone calls to the office.</p>
        <p>The booking system should be simple to use. Ask for only essential information. Offer a clear calendar view of available time slots.</p>
        <p>Integrate the booking system with the practice management software. This prevents double-bookings and keeps schedules up-to-date.</p>
        <p>Send automatic confirmation emails after bookings. Include appointment details and any pre-visit instructions. This improves the patient experience and reduces no-shows.</p>
