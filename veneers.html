      <h2>Why Celebrities Opt for Veneers</h2>
      <div class="why-veneers__content">
      <p>Dental veneers have become a go-to solution for celebrities looking to enhance their smiles. Here are some of the reasons why this cosmetic dental procedure is so popular among the stars:</p>
        <ol class="why-veneers__list">
        <li class="why-veneers__item">
        <h3>Aesthetic Perfection</h3>
        <p>Veneers provide a quick and effective way to achieve a flawless smile. They can address a range of issues, including discoloration, misalignment, gaps, and irregularities, creating a picture-perfect appearance that’s camera-ready.</p>
      </li>
        <li class="why-veneers__item">
        <h3>Durability and Longevity</h3>
        <p>Made from high-quality materials like porcelain or composite resin, veneers are durable and can last 10 to 15 years with proper care. Their longevity makes them a worthwhile investment for maintaining a consistently stunning smile.</p>
      </li>
        <li class="why-veneers__item">
        <h3>Minimally Invasive Procedure</h3>
        <p>The application of veneers typically involves minimal preparation of the natural teeth, preserving their structure. This non-invasive approach makes veneers an attractive option for those seeking significant improvements without extensive dental work.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="why-veneers__item">
        <h3>Instant Transformation</h3>
        <p>Unlike orthodontic treatments that can take years, veneers offer an almost instant transformation. Within just a few visits to the dentist, patients can achieve the smile of their dreams.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="why-veneers__item">
        <h3>Customizable Design</h3>
        <p>Veneers are tailored to each individual’s needs, ensuring they complement facial features and personal style. From the shape and size to the shade of white, veneers can be customized for a natural and harmonious look.</p>
